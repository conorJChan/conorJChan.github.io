Conor finally pooped!

This past week, Conor trouble pooping, going just once in the last 7
days. We were getting nervous about his lack of poop.

Jasmine finished feeding Conor at 3:30 AM and his stomach was churning. We
heard a gurgling noise and thought that Conor farted. We checked his diaper and
much to our excitement, he had pooped!  

We started changing Conor but he was not finished pooping. He had a second poop
while we changed him. It went all over his swaddle, mattress, and through the
netting of his pack-and-play.

Going forward, we wait for 5 minutes after the first poop wave to make sure
Conor is finished before changing his diaper after he poops.
