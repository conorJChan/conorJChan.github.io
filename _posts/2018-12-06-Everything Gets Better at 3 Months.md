### Conor Turns 3 Months!  
Everything has been getting better for Conor at 3 months. He has started to eat
and sleep better. He is crying less, and "talking" and smiling more.  

By far the biggest difference is Conor's sleep. He is able to sleep longer
through the night. We are using Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit instead of a
swaddle. The suit prevents Conor from scratching his face as much and helps
calm him when he gets startled at night.

We switched bottles to Philips Avent and that has helped him eat better. They
have wider mouths and nipples than the Dr. Brown's style bottles that we were
previously using.
