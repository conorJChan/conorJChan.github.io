### Teething
Conor has been having pain from teething. He drools heavily and rubs his gums
with his fingers to soothe the pain. He also has been much more picky with
food. There are many things that he previously ate that he no longer will eat.

### Transitioning away from pacifiers and bottles
Conor was able to instantly transition away from his pacifier. One week we
stopped using it and he was able to sleep without it.

Trying to transition away from bottles to straw cups and sippy cups has been
difficult. Conor refuses to drink any liquids from cups. He doesn't drink
anything other than milk from a bottle.
