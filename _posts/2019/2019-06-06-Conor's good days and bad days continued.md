### Conor's good and bad days continued
Conor's continuing to have his good days and bad days. His good days are when he
finishes all his food, can sit by himself, and sleeps without waking up.  

Conor's bad days are when he is whiny and vomiting. He's still having issues
falling asleep by himself and in the some instances, vomits in the crib (around
2 to 3 times a week).

Conor's hair is filling out. He has curly hair, similar to his mom when she was a
baby!
