### Conor's Five Month & Regression    
Conor took a step back in his fourth month. He has had an increase in crying,
screaming, and vomiting. When we put him down for the night, he will cry
intensely, until he turns red in the face and starts coughing. If he keeps
going, he is unable to breath and begins to vomit.  

On the positive side, Conor laughs and smiles much more during the day.
