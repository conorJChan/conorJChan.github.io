### Conor sits up, smiles, wiggles, and coos
Conor has been much improved at daycare. He cries much less when awake and is
able to take long naps. He laughs when you talk to him and wiggles when he is on
his back. He talks baby talk throughout the day.

Conor is able to sit up on his own. He loves chewing on his Sofie the giraffe
toy. In fact, he eats everything in his vicinity -- toys, pillows,
clothes, books, and body parts.
