### Standing and waving
Conor has learned to pull himself up from a seated to a standing position. He
stays standing for a few minutes until he tires then falls on his bottom.

Learning to stand triggered something in Conor where he is no longer able to
play with his old toys. He's too busy thinking about standing and quickly
dismisses toys in exchange for trying to stand.

Conor learned to wave hello and goodbye. He adds his own sound effect (a low
moaning noise) when he waves.

### Sleep regression
Conor experienced sleep regression where he cries in his sleep to the point
where he vomits. He is calm when someone is in the room to calm him, but
resumes crying when he is left alone.
