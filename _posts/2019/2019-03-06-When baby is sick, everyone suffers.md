### Conor's Six Month & Stomach Bug    
Conor began his first month in daycare. After a few days, he caught a stomach
bug and vomited after every feeding. We had to do laundry daily because he
constantly needed to change outfits, sheets, and sleep suits. He lost his
appetite and his ability to sleep through the night.  

It was scary feed Conor only Pedialyte. The usage instructions are
strange--5 to 10 mL every 5 minutes. It's like simulating an IV drop.  

After 3 or 4 days of vomiting, Conor recovered but then he caught a cold! He
had a runny nose and was sneezing and coughing for two weeks. Luckily, he slowly
recovered and went back to daycare after he recovered from his stomach bug.  

Conor has began to wiggle like a worm when he lies on his back. He also smiles
all the time now.
