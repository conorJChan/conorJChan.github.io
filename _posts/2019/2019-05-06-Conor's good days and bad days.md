### Conor's good and bad days
Conor has his good days and bad days. His good days are when he smiles and laughs
and is able to nap and sleep. On these days he finishes all his food and sleeps
through the night.

Conor's bad days are when he is fussy, whiny, crying, and vomiting. There are
times when he is not feeling well and has a few bad days. The hardest days are
when he vomits in or around the crib. Everything must be swapped out including
his outfit, sleep suit, crib sheets, crib protector, etc . . .
