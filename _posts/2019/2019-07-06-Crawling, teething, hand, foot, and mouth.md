### Crawling, teething, hand, foot, and mouth
Conor has learned to crawl! His path to crawling was more sudden than gradual.
Before crawling, he had been able to push himself up from a prone position to
a seated one but there were no clear signs of him being able to crawl. Then one
day, he started crawling.

Conor also has his bottom two teeth coming in. They are only partially grown
but this should help him in his chewing. Currently, he has problems chewing
chunky foods and has to stick with purees and soft foods.

Also, Conor has been much improved in vomiting in the crib. He still has his
tantrums when he is unable to sleep but he hasn't been vomiting during this
time.

Conor contracted hand, foot, and mouth disease. He had little blisters on his
hands, feet, knees, and mouth. It was difficult for him to eat and he developed
a fever. But the blisters fever went way after a few days.
