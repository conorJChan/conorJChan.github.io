### Bottles
Conor loves drinking milk from bottles. When given milk in a bottle, he drinks
the entire bottle in one attempt. He has a difficult time drinking from cups.
He refuses to drink from a cup or will drink a few sips and not finish.

We have repeately tried and failed to transition him away from bottles. But
recently, he has been much improved drinking from his straw cup. He doesn't
finish the whole cup but he usually manages a few sips.

### Where's Conor? Where's mommy? Where's daddy?
When we ask Conor the question "Where's Conor?", he points to himself. When we
ask him the question "Where's daddy?", he points to daddy. WHen we ask him the
question "Where's mommy?", he shruggs.
