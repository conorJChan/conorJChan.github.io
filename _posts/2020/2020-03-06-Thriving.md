### Thriving
Conor has made strides in his life. He abilities to talk is improved. He's able
to say words like "apple" and if we say a word like "blueberry", he'll try to
mimic the word.

Conor's willingness to sleep is improved. He starts walking to his crib when
it's approaching bedtime. Although he still needs someone to stay with him until
he falls asleep, he cries much less than he previously cried during his bedtime
routine.

Conor's ability to eat by himself is improved. He can attack a bowl of oatmeal
by himself. He devours fruit. He always has an appetite for apples, bananas,
blackberries, blueberries, oranges, rasberries.

### Staying healthy
For the most part, since Conor has been healthy since returning from Singapore.
He had a few days where he had stomach issues and was vomititng but even during
that period, he didn't have a fever. Conor's even managed to avoid most colds,
sneeezing, and coughing. He's been able to stay healthy through the coldest
months of the year.
