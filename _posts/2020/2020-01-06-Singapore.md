### Singapore
Conor visited Singapore over Christmast break. He attended Uncle Jonathan 
and Aunt Wei's wedding. He was reunited with his grandma and grandpa. He 
got to meet his great grandma and great grandpa and many other family and  
friends for the first time.  

### Sick
When Conor arrived in Singapore, he was sick for one week. He had no appetite 
and had trouble sleeping. He had lesions on his skin most likely resulting 
from hand foot and mouth or chickenpox. He also had a cough and runny nose.    

### Jet lag  
Conor was jet lagged the whole time while in Singapore. He had trouble 
sleeping through the night and woke up one or two times for an hour or two. 
His nap schedule was erratic and he took one or two naps of varying lengths 
each day.  

### Traumatic flight    
Conor's flight home was traumatic. He had trouble sleeping and cried for hours 
until he got sick on the plane.
