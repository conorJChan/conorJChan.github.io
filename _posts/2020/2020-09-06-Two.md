### Conor Turns Two!
Conor turned two years old! He celebrated his birthday at the park with his
cousins, Elston and Miles. There was a bean bag toss, soccer, frisbee, bubbles, 
and hide-and-seek. Conor loved the food and snacks. He spent the entire party
hovering around the eating area refilling his plate with snacks, fruit, and
other goodies.

### ABCs and 123s
Conor has been working on his alphabet and numbers. He's able to sing the
alphabet song and recite his numbers.
